Still in progress.

Website allowing user to create combination of moves that are displayed in real time on 3d model using three.js (react three fiber). In the future there will be a lot of different models for popular types of robots (robo-spider with 4/6 legs, robo-dog, pick and place machine, rc car and a lot more).

For now commands can only be practically used by copying to the clipboard in form of list of objects and manually placing them in your code but in the future there will be API allowing users to create/view/share commands that will be stored in database and I'll provide open endpoints that you will be able to use to fetch those commands without manually copying.
